### Overview

We have all heard that html tables are bad but there are times when you need to display tabular style data.  However, you also need it to look decent on a mobile device.  In my case, for my [Visual Shortcuts post]({{site.url}}/visual-studio-shortcuts/), I wanted to display a name and value 2 column table.  However, this table initially screwed with my mobile view and made the site scroll left to right on mobile devices.  

Instead, I wanted the table to transform to a view that didn't make the page scroll left to right.  Luckily, with a little bit of googling I was able to figure it out. Special thanks to [Css Tricks]( https://css-tricks.com/responsive-data-tables/) for the great starting article.

### Conclusion

Even though you won't use table that often, there are still times that they are useful and you want them to look good even on mobile devices.  With the little bit of CSS in this article, you can accomplish this.  Please though don't go table crazy and start using them everywhere.
